  [{:line "                 THE ADVENTURES OF TOM THUMB"}
   {:line ""}
   {:line "   Once upon a time . . . there lived a giant who had quarrelled with a very "}
   {:line "greedy wizard over sharing a treasure. After the quarrel, the giant said "}
   {:line "menacingly to the wizard:"}
   {:line "   \"I could crush you under my thumb if I wanted to! Now, get out of my "}
   {:line "sight!\" The wizard hurried away, but from a safe distance, he hurled his "}
   {:line "terrible revenge."}
   {:line "   \"Abracadabra! Here I cast this spell! May the son, your wife will shortly "}
   {:line "give you, never grow any taller than my own thumb!\""}
   {:line "   After Tom Thumb was born, his parents were at their wits' end. They could "}
   {:line "never find him, for they could barely see him. They had to speak in whispers "}
   {:line "for fear of deafening the little boy. Tom Thumb preferred playing with the "}
   {:line "little garden creatures, to the company of parents so different from himself. "}
   {:line "He rode piggyback on the snail and danced with the ladybirds. Tiny as he was, "}
   {:line "he had great fun in the world of little things."}
   {:line "   But one unlucky day, he went to visit a froggy friend. No sooner had he "}
   {:line "scrambled onto a leaf than a large pike swallowed him up. But the pike too was"}
   {:line "fated to come to a very bad end. A little later, he took the bait cast by one "}
   {:line "of the King's fishermen, and before long, found himself under the cook's knife"}
   {:line "in the royal kitchens. And great was everyone's surprise when, out of the "}
   {:line "fish's stomach, stepped Tom Thumb, quite alive and little the worse for his "}
   {:line "adventure."}
   {:line "   \"What am I to do with this tiny lad?\" said the cook to himself. Then he had"}
   {:line "a brainwave. \"He can be a royal pageboy! He's so tiny, I can pop him into the "}
   {:line "cake I'm making. When he marches across the bridge, sounding the trumpet "}
   {:line "everyone will gasp in wonder!\" Never had such a marvel been seen at Court. The"}
   {:line "guests clapped excitedly at the cook's skill and the King himself clapped "}
   {:line "loudest of all. The King rewarded the clever cook with a bag of gold. Tom "}
   {:line "Thumb was even luckier. The cook made him a pageboy, and a pageboy he remained,"}
   {:line "enjoying all the honours of his post."}
   {:line "   He had a white mouse for a mount, a gold pin for a sword and he was allowed"}
   {:line "to eat the King's food. In exchange, he marched up and down the table at "}
   {:line "banquets. He picked his way amongst the plates and glasses amusing the guests"}
   {:line "with his trumpet."}
   {:line "   What Tom Thumb didn't know was that he had made an enemy. The cat which, "}
   {:line "until Tom's arrival, had been the King's pet, was now forgotten. And, vowing "}
   {:line "to have its revenge on the newcomer, it ambushed Tom in the garden. When Tom "}
   {:line "saw the cat, he did not run away, as the creature had intended. He whipped out"}
   {:line "his gold pin and cried to his white mouse mount:"}
   {:line "   \"Charge! Charge!\" Jabbed by the tiny sword, the cat turned tail and fled. "}
   {:line "Since brute force was not the way to revenge, the cat decided to use guile. "}
   {:line "Casually pretending to bump into the King as he walked down the staircase, the"}
   {:line "cat softly miaowed:"}
   {:line "   \"Sire! Be on your guard! A plot is being hatched against your life!\" And"}
   {:line "then he told a dreadful lie. \"Tom Thumb is planning to lace your food with "}
   {:line "hemlock. I saw him picking the leaves in the garden the other day. heard him "}
   {:line "say these very words!\""}
   {:line "   Now, the King had once been kept in bed with very bad tummy pains, after "}
   {:line "eating too many chernes and he feared the thought of being poisoned, so he "}
   {:line "sent for Tom Thumb. The cat provided proof of his words by pulling a hemlock "}
   {:line "leaf from under the white mouse's saddle cloth, where he had hidden it "}
   {:line "himself."}
   {:line "   Tom Thumb was so amazed, he was at a loss for words to deny what the cat "}
   {:line "had said. The King, withiut further ado, had him thrown into prison. And since"}
   {:line "he was so tiny, they locked him up in a pendulum clock. The hours passed and"}
   {:line "the days too. Tom's only pastime was swinging back and forth, clinging to the "}
   {:line "pendulum, util the night when he attracted the attention of a big night moth,"}
   {:line "fluttering round the room."}
   {:line "   \"Let me out!\" cried Tom Thumb, tapping on the glass. As it so happens, the "}
   {:line "moth had only just been set free after being a prisoner in a large box, in "}
   {:line "which she had taken a nap. So she took pity on Tom Thumb  and released him."}
   {:line "   'll take you to the Butterfly Kingdom, where everyone's tiny like burself. "}
   {:line "They'll take care of you there!\" And that is what happened. To this day, if "}
   {:line "you visit the Butterfly Kingdom, you can ask to see the Butterfly monument "}
   {:line "that Tom Thumb built after this amazing adventrure."}])
