Experiments in data-driven security operations using stream
processing.

## Usage

### Launch the Sample Job in Development

Run the `deftest`s in `test/desdemona/jobs/sample_job_test.clj`. The
tests automatically start and stop the development environment, so
make sure you don't already have the dev environment (explained below)
running - otherwise you'd get a port conflict.

### Using from a REPL

Fire up your favorite REPL or use `lein repl` (ideally with `rlwrap` so you
get reasonable line editing). You will be placed in the `user` namespace,
which should come pre-loaded with a number of functions to help you set up a
development environment, notably:

 * `(go 4)` sets up a development environment with 4 peers.
 * `(reset)` resets your development environment.
 * `(stop)` stops your development environment.

You can launch a sample job as follows:

```clojure
(user/go 4)
(require 'desdemona.jobs.sample-submit-job)
(desdemona.jobs.sample-submit-job/submit-job user/system)
```

### Using Docker Compose

Start the cluster:

```
docker-compose up
```

Wait until it's all started. It should say this and then wait:

```
peer_1      | Started peers. Blocking forever.
```

Make sure you create the Kafka topic:

```
docker run --rm -it --link desdemona_kafka_1:kafka1 kafka bash -c "\$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic test1 --broker-list=kafka1:9092"
```

And the MySQL database:

```
docker run -it --link desdemona_db_1:mysql --rm mysql sh -c 'exec mysql -h"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR" -P"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT" -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"'
```

```
use logs;
CREATE TABLE logLines (id int primary key auto_increment, line text);
```

Now you can submit the job:

```
ZOOKEEPER=$(echo $DOCKER_HOST|cut -d ':' -f 2|sed "s/\/\///g") lein run -m desdemona.jobs.sample-submit-job
```

Anything you send to syslog on that Docker host (there's a syslog-ng relay running as a container) will appear in MySQL.

### Production Mode Peers

First start the Aeron media driver, which should be used in production
mode, by running the main function in
`src/desdemona/launcher/aeron_media_driver.clj`.

Then launch the `src/desdemona/launcher/launch_prod_peers.clj` main
function, giving it an Onyx ID. Optionally, a Dockerfile has been
created at the root of the project to package this up into a
reproducible Java 8 environment.

### Launch the Sample Job in Production

Launch the `src/desdemona/launcher/submit_prod_sample_job.clj` main
function, giving it an Onyx ID and ZooKeeper address.
